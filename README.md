# NPPCast: Grouped Time-Series Casting for Global Ocean NPP Forecasts

**Data (Zenodo):** DOI to be added upon release (will appear here and in the paper references)

## Overview
NPPCast reformulates large-scale spatiotemporal forecasting as a set of grouped multivariate time-series problems. After masking non-ocean cells and partitioning the ocean grid into G groups, a TimesNet-based regional forecaster is trained per group, and outputs are fused into global maps. The repo reproduces all tables/figures in the paper.
